Operators in php
    Comparison operators:
     ==  Equal
     === Identical
     !=  Not equal
     !== Not Identical
     <>  Same of != 
     >
     <
     >=
     <=
     <=> if is less than => return -1
         if are equal => return 0
         if is greater => return 1

    Logical operators:
     and
     or
     xor
     &&
     ||
     !
    
    String operators:
     . concatenation strings in another string
       e.g  $z = $txt1 . $txt2;
     .= concatenation assignment to concatenate the same string
       e.g $txt1 .= $txt2;
    
    Array Operators:
     + Union
     == Equality; same key/value pairs in different order
     === Identity, same key/value pairs in the same order and same types
     != Inequality 
     <> Inequality
     !== Non-identity, if are not identical
    
    Conditional Assinment operators:
     ?:  Ternary operator
         e.g  $x = $txt1 === "Hola" ? "IsHola" : "IsMundo";
     ??  Null coalescing
         e.g $x = expr1 ?? expr2
            Returns the value of $x is expr1 exists and is not NULL
            if expr1 doesn't exist/NULL; the value $x is expr2
     ??=
        e.g $_SERVER['PHP_ENV'] ??= 'default';
