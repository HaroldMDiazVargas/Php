Variables vs Constants
    Variables
     - Containers to store pieces of info we want to track through my program
    Constants:
     - Containers to store data we want to re-use, we don't set/modify it
    
    Defining variables:
     - We can define variables just using the syntax:
     -  $varName = value
     -  e.g $characterName = "Harold";
     -      $characterAge = 25;
    
    Defining constants:
     1. Using const 
        We define our constant at compile time, but is not possible define 
        constant using this keyword dynamically(at runtime)
     2. Using define()
        We use this when we want to define a constant at runtime, but of course 
        is essential the same than const!

    Differences:
     - Constants don't change its value and we can't not use in quotes of echo
     - Variables values can change and we can use inside the quotes of echo!
