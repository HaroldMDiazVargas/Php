Cookies
    Definition:
     - We use cookies often to identify a user. Cookie is a small file that the server
       embeds on the user's computer.
     - Each time the same computer requests a page with a browser, it will send the cookie too
     
    Php cookies:
     - With php we can:
       - create cookie values
       - retrieve cookie values
    
    setcookie() function:
     - This takes => setcookie(name, value, expire, path, domain, secure, httponly);
     - Only the name param is required
    
    Note: The setcookie() function must appear BEFORE the <html> tag.

    We can also:
     - Check if cookie is enable
     - delete a cookie
     - modify a cookie

    cookies vs localStorage:
     - cookies are intended to be read by the server, but also can be read by 
       browser of course
     - localStorage are only read by the browser

-- php file 

<?php
$cookie_name = "user";
$cookie_value = "John Doe";
setcookie($cookie_name, $cookie_value, time() + (86400 * 30), "/"); // 86400 = 1 day
?>
<html lang="en">

<body>



<?php
if(!isset($_COOKIE[$cookie_name])) {
  echo "Cookie named '" . $cookie_name . "' is not set!";
} else {
  echo "Cookie '" . $cookie_name . "' is set!<br>";
  echo "Value is: " . $_COOKIE[$cookie_name];
}
?>

</body>
</html>
