    php vs HTML
      - php is very tighly couple with HTML
      - So we need to know a basics knowledge of html
      - We can write html in our php file and will run as usual
    
    php tag:
      - We can create a php tag and inside that we can run our php code
      - syntax:
        <?php  ... ?>
      - Anything we put inside the php tag is considered php code
    

    echo():
      - This is a php instruction to print something in the screen
        e.g echo("Hello World");
      - We can put inside the quotes any HTML code and it will render in the browser
