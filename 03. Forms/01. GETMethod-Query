Form GET Method
    Definition:
     - We can define our form using HTML and we can define the method to send our data
     - "get" method indicated we send data as Query String Params!
    
    Query String params:
     - These are string params after question mark appended in our URL
     - So here the info is exposed!
     - The name of these query params will be defined in HTML native forms by the 
       name attribute!
       In framework such as angular, we can define these query params in our templates!

    Reading Query String params:
     - To read these params we use $_GET[] function and we pass the name of our 
       param!
       e.g $_GET["name"]

<body>

    <form action="site.php" method="get">
        <label for="name">Name</label>
        <input type="text" name="name" id="name">
        <label for="age">Age</label>
        <input type="number" name="age" id="age">
        <button type="submit">Submit info</button>
    </form>

    <br></br>
    Your name is <?php  echo $_GET["name"] ?>
    <br></br>
    Your age is <?php  echo $_GET["age"] ?>

</body>
</html>
